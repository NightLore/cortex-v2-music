# MoodMusic
When EmotivBCI has a headset connect, run 
```bash
python main.py
```
in order to start MoodMusic recommendation services.

Run
```bash
python example.py
```
in order to start MoodMusic recommendation services without the headset. This will essentially replace the headset with a random stats generator.

The library of music used is in the music folder and will thus be based on what has been given to the program to recommend.
